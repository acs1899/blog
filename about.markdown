### Who is this guy?

This is a super two huo who graduated from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China][uni-ol], majored in Optoelectronic Information but didn't give a shit, escaped all classes to study computer science. And now become a senior Jiangyou in [Sina SAE][company].

E-Game lover, Code lover, Music lover, not a big fan of sports but a super fake fan of [Chelsea][sport]. Never forget watching the collection of great goals after a game of Chelsea. 

Now got a [girlfriend][gf] who calls herself with a great coding gift but just do not want to learn. Cause she's afraid to steel my thunder. And she is easily going creazy when I don't play with her.
